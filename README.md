# SudokuCreator
Creates a basic sudoku board game.
The program creates a GUI where the user is able to play a game of sudoku.
The player types a value in the textfield and then presses one of the buttons representing a sudoku
square. If the value typed is correct, then the button updates to that value. If the value is
incorrect, then the button doesn't update when pressed.
